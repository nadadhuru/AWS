For each environment - we can have a different Auto Scaling Group with different launch configuration.

For Auto Sclaing Group - we configure as follows:
In Dev - we use only 1 Subnet/availability zone in SF
In SYS - We use 2 Subnets/Availability Zones in SF

1st step is to create a Launch Configuration with specifics such as Choosing AMI, Choose Instance Type, Configure Details (IAM Role, BootStrap script, IP Address Type), Add Storage, Configure Security Groups, Review etc.
2nd step is to create a AutoScaling group with No of instances, Subnet, ELB, HealthCheckType, etc.
